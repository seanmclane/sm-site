##Secrets
Throughout my exploration of Zion, I noticed posts on Instagram of ice with familiar sandstone walls but intentionally no details.

Why do we keep climbs and climbing areas secret?

####Valid Reasons
1) *Letting others know prematurely could hurt the area's ethic* - The argument goes that controlling early access prevents people from changing .

Why is your ethic so fragile? Why won't people respect it? 

####Morally Ambiguous Reasons
1) *Preventing random people from trespassing and souring relationships with landowners* - The problem is... you're already trespassing...

####Bullshit Reasons
1) *Keeping your personal crag free from outsiders* - You deserve a personal crag on public land?
2) *The area is sensitive and can't handle the traffic* - Being secretive avoids addressing the root cause. If the area has the potential to attract high traffic but is sensitive in some way, an actual land management plan needs to be put in place with the landowner. No worthy area stays secret forever.
